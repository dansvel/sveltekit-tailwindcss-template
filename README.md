# my sveltekit tailwindcss boilerplate for my project (without typescript)

I might add some feature in far future, but for now this is enough for my project

```
pnpx degit dansvel/sveltekit-tailwind-template myproject
cd myproject
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## todo?

- add adapter?
- what else is possible
